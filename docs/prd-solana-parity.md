# PRD: Solana ↔ EVM Production Parity

**Status**: Decided — 2026-05-15
**Owner**: TBD (assign before Phase S0 kickoff)
**Decision**: Move from "EVM canonical / Solana distribution" to **symmetric production-ready stacks on both chains**.

---

## 1. Goal

Bring the Solana stack to the same production-readiness bar as the EVM stack so that every monetization, governance, and rights surface available on Base/Sepolia is available on Solana mainnet-beta with equivalent audit coverage, multisig custody, indexing, and UI.

### Non-goals

- Replacing EVM with Solana. EVM stays canonical for IP and rights.
- Reimplementing primitives that have battle-tested Solana-native equivalents (Realms/SPL Governance, Jupiter, Metaplex Core, Tensor/ME, Streamflow). Use them where viable.
- Net-new product features. Parity only — every new capability added to EVM during this work item must be added in parallel to the Solana plan or explicitly waived.

## 2. Current State (2026-05-15)

### Already at parity or near-parity

| Capability              | EVM                                   | Solana                                                      |

| Auth                    | SIWE + JWT                            | SIWS + JWT (ns/evm/sol claims, linked sessions)             |
| Universe primitive      | `Universe.sol`, `UniverseManager.sol` | `programs/universe` (PDA, hash-equivalent to EVM)           |
| Episode mint            | `EpisodeNFT.sol`                      | `programs/episode` + Bubblegum cNFT                         |
| Canon promotion         | `EpisodeCanonized` event              | `episode::canonize` → Metaplex Core asset                   |

| Cross-chain attestation | —                                     | Ed25519 over `{schema, mintedAt, solana, evm, lineage}`     |

### Real gaps — monetization + rights layer

The EVM stack has ~24 contracts of monetization and rights logic that have **no Solana equivalent**. This is where the asymmetry lives.

---

## 3. Gap Inventory

Mapping each EVM contract → Solana approach. **Strategy** column:

- `port` — write an Anchor program
- `native` — use a Solana-native protocol (don't reimplement)
- `n/a` — not needed on Solana (factory pattern, hook pattern, etc.)
- `defer` — explicit v2

### Marketplaces + rights (P0 — most user-visible parity gap)

| EVM contract              | Solana strategy | Notes                                                                                    | Complexity |

### Tally

- **port (custom Anchor)**: 12 — Canon, Licensing×2, Rights, Escrow, Subscription, Credit, BondingCurve, Staking, Collab, FeeLocker, Burner, Remix, Split (≈14 if counting all)
- **native (SDK glue)**: 12 — Slop/secondary, Vesting, LpLock, Swap, Governor, NFTs ×6
- **n/a**: 10 — factories, hooks, faucet, renderer, etc.
- **done**: 5 — Token, TokenSpoke, PaymentRouter, UniverseTokenDeployer, UniverseFactory replacement

---

## 4. Cross-Cutting Workstreams

### W1. Anchor audit (HARD BLOCKER for mainnet)

- Engage Solana-native firm: **OtterSec**, **Neodyme**, **Sec3**, **Halborn**. 2-4 week lead time + 4-6 week report.
- Two passes: (1) current 3 programs (universe/episode/payment) — schedule now, no code changes pending; (2) full ported program suite — schedule after Phase 2 below.
- Budget: ~$80-150k for each pass (estimate). Total Solana audit cost ≈ $200k.
- Cross-reference: every new finding gets a row in [audit-fix-tracker.md](audit-fix-tracker.md) with `chain: solana` prefix to keep one tracker, two chains.

### W2. Mainnet-beta deploy

- Currently devnet. Follow [solana-mainnet-runbook.md](solana-mainnet-runbook.md).
- Cost: program deploys ~$30-80, Bubblegum tree depth=14 ~$200, $LOAR mint creation ~$5, Squads vaults ~$10.
- Sequencing: must follow W1 pass 1.

### W3. Wormhole NTT migration

- Code path exists in [`wormhole-bridge.ts`](../apps/server/src/lib/wormhole-bridge.ts).
- Deploy NTT Manager + Transceiver on both chains + peer-register. 3-5 day on-chain setup.
- Keep custodial backend live as fallback until NTT proves out for 30 days.
- Trust upgrade: server custodian → Wormhole guardian quorum.

### W4. Squads multisig handover

- Operational, no code. Same shape as the EVM Safe handover (GOV-01 in audit tracker).
- Targets: program upgrade authority, $LOAR mint authority, bridge custodian (until W3 lands), tree creator.
- Script exists: `apps/programs/scripts/transfer-upgrade-authority.ts <vault>`.

### W5. Indexer IDL decoder ✅ shipped 2026-05-15

- Switched from hand-built borsh + `sha256("event:<Name>")[..8]` discriminators to IDL-driven decode via `@coral-xyz/anchor`'s `BorshEventCoder`.
- New: `apps/solana-indexer/src/program-registry.ts` — central registry. Adding a new ported program = one line.
- New: `apps/solana-indexer/scripts/smoke-decoder.ts` — round-trip smoke against deterministic payloads.
- Payment program now indexed (was missing). All events from any registered program land in `solanaEvents` collection with `program / eventName / payload` fields; typed handlers still fire for Universe/Episode.
- Unblocks: every Phase S1-S3 ported program auto-indexes the moment its IDL is registered, with no per-event borsh code.

### W6. UI symmetry

- Surfaces missing on Solana side: `/marketplace/canon`, `/marketplace/slop`, `/license/*`, `/rights/*`, `/governance/*`, `/staking/*`.
- Pattern: existing pages stay EVM-default with a chain selector. Don't fork pages per chain — branch on `useChain()` at the data-fetch layer.
- Solana Pay UI: shipped (`SolanaPayButton`). Solana Pay subscription UI: TBD with `SubscriptionManager` port.

### W7. SDK + docs

- Update `apps/mcp` tool surface to mirror EVM tools 1:1.
- `apps/programs/README.md` updated per ported program.
- New: `docs/solana-parity-matrix.md` — auto-generated from this PRD, kept in sync.

---

## 5. Sequencing

Slots into the existing EVM 8-phase audit-fix plan ([audit-fix-tracker.md](audit-fix-tracker.md)). Solana work runs in **parallel tracks**, not serial — EVM audit fix engineers and Anchor engineers are different people.

### Phase S0 — Audit kickoff + foundations cleanup (weeks 1-4)

- Engage audit firm for W1 pass 1 (`universe` / `episode` / `payment` as-is).
- Tighten `programs/payment` per any EVM PaymentRouter fixes already landed.
- Finalize IDL emission + indexer IDL decoder skeleton (W5).
- **Exit criteria**: audit pass 1 engagement signed, IDL decoder shipped.

### Phase S1 — Rights + licensing port (weeks 4-10)

Most-load-bearing parity work. Without these, original IP can be minted on Solana but not commercially distributed there.

- `programs/rights` (RightsRegistry port) — **✅ devnet 2026-05-15**. Program ID `NDpYpB49e3yzEcsPK1o34h9Zgrw9CPnVTnZLvDowL4m`. Config PDA `8k9xmQu5PonYDbhdPNfVuBRZxT179A65t4WnGXzeziZz` initialized. IDL published. Server SDK + EVM→Solana sync service shipped. EVM `submitSetRightsWithCreatorSig` caller in `likenessMarketplace.routes.ts` now fires `syncRightsHashToSolana` post-receipt (non-fatal, monotonic version). Anchor tests + smoke green. Init script: `apps/programs/scripts/init-rights.ts`.
- `programs/licensing` (ContentLicensing port, BUY only in v1) — **✅ devnet 2026-05-15**. Program ID `HTQhzknwF5mnnhHVSaF5ckRbeviwX2UuwayPNjiQybTp`. Config PDA `4keaYuQaM9Er6f2CQfuR84KG3dmm2ssCSZaDPumshwgH` initialized. Depends on `rights` crate (Cargo `path = "../rights"`) so registration gate validates `is_monetizable()` against the Rights PDA at the Anchor account-constraint level. RENT/LICENSE deal types deferred to S2 (Solana fee/lockup conventions diverge enough from EVM time-bound deals to warrant a separate design pass). Init script: `apps/programs/scripts/init-licensing.ts`.
- `programs/escrow` (Escrow port) — **❌ deferred, audit-gated**. EVM `ESCROW-03` (single-EOA `resolveDispute` dictatorship) is `[~] PARTIAL` in audit-fix-tracker — full fix (DAO appeal path) blocked on GOV-01 Safe/Timelock handover. Porting to Solana now would inherit the design-level vulnerability. Will unblock once ESCROW-03 lands as `[x] FIXED`.
- Cross-chain rights sync: EVM RightsRegistry events → Solana program via attestation
- UI: `/license/*` chain-aware
- **Exit criteria**: full rights cycle works on Solana devnet (issue → enforce → revoke), parity test suite green.

### Phase S2 — Marketplace + staking + governance (weeks 8-16, overlaps S1)

- `programs/canon-market` (CanonMarketplace port — all 4 P0 EVM CANON-01/02/03/04 are `[x] FIXED` per audit-fix-tracker; gate clear)
- `programs/staking` (LaunchpadStaking port — STAKE-01 + STAKE-02 `[x] FIXED`; gate clear)
- `programs/bonding-curve` (BondingCurve port)
- Realms / SPL Governance wiring per universe
- Tensor / ME secondary-market SDK glue (no `programs/slop` — use native)
- **Exit criteria**: end-to-end universe lifecycle on Solana — create → bond → launch → canon → trade → govern.

### Phase S3 — Subscriptions, credits, splits, NFTs (weeks 14-20, overlaps S2)

- `programs/subscription` + Solana Pay recurring intents (SUB-01/02/04 `[x] FIXED`; gate clear)
- `programs/credit-manager` (CREDIT-01..06 `[x] FIXED`; gate clear)
- `programs/split_router` — **✅ devnet 2026-05-15**. Program ID `7hcFnt2Tgzi1Sc3PDWqAQRFb6BoRmEtmoizBSLaYCGkr`. Config PDA `HCF7ZutJ79xa6kF8d3jdJqBxBt5Ces64Z4cddkiN9c5u`. SOL routing with platform-fee deduction + co-creator splits, 1-day cooldown (SPLIT-02 analog), 10000-bps total enforcement, last-recipient rounding-dust pattern, MAX_RECIPIENTS=10, MAX_FEE_BPS=5000. SPL token routing deferred to v2.
- Metaplex Core wiring for CharacterNFT / EntityNFT / IdentityNFT / StructuralDeed
- **Exit criteria**: payment/subscription/credit/NFT surfaces all chain-aware.

### Phase S4 — Audit pass 2 + Wormhole NTT (weeks 18-26)

- W1 pass 2: full program suite audit.
- W3: deploy NTT contracts + migrate.
- W4: Squads handover on all authorities.
- Bridge round-trip stress test + reconciliation alerting.
- **Exit criteria**: zero open audit P0/P1, NTT live for 30 days, Squads holds all authorities.

### Phase S5 — Mainnet-beta launch (weeks 24-28)

- W2: follow [solana-mainnet-runbook.md](solana-mainnet-runbook.md).
- Run mainnet-runbook-dryrun.ts read-only against mainnet.
- Soft launch: 7-day allowlist period, real cap on caps, monitor reconciliation drift hourly.
- Open registration.

**Total**: ~28 weeks (~7 months) parallel to EVM phases 3-8.

## 6. Resourcing

- **Anchor engineering**: 2-3 FTE for 6 months.
- **Frontend (chain-aware UI)**: 1 FTE for 4 months (overlaps S1-S3).
- **Indexer + DevOps**: 0.5 FTE for 6 months.
- **Audit**: ~$200k cash (two passes).
- **Mainnet on-chain costs**: ~$500 (deploys + trees + mint setup).
- **NTT setup**: ~$200 (deploys) + Wormhole integration time.

**Conservative budget**: $200k audit + ~$0.9M-$1.5M loaded eng cost depending on rates.

## 7. Risks + Open Questions

| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| EVM audit findings drift while Solana ports are in flight — ported version inherits bugs | Gate every Solana port on the EVM source contract being audit-clean (`[x] FIXED` in tracker).                                                |
| Realms / SPL Governance UX mismatch with EVM `UniverseGovernor`                          | Build a thin abstraction layer in [`apps/web/src/lib/governance.ts`](../apps/web/src/lib/governance.ts) (new). Same hook, different backend. |
| Rights state divergence between chains                                                   | RightsRegistry on EVM stays canonical. Solana program reads attestation, never writes rights authoritatively. Same model as IP.              |
| Mainnet-beta deploy before audit pass 2                                                  | Hard-gate: do not deploy ported programs to mainnet without W1 pass 2 clean.                                                                 |
| Wormhole NTT integration delays Phase S5                                                 | Custodial bridge stays live as fallback; NTT migration can land post-mainnet.                                                                |
| Squads v4 API breaking changes                                                           | Pin SDK version, run regression test on every bump.                                                                                          |
| $LOAR cross-chain supply drift if bridge fails                                           | Hourly reconciliation cron + pagerduty (already wired in `bridge-reconcile.ts`).                                                             |

### Decisions (resolved 2026-05-15)

1. **Audit tracker** → **Single tracker.** Solana findings land in [audit-fix-tracker.md](audit-fix-tracker.md) with `chain: solana` rows. One source of truth, same priority legend, same SLA. Avoids two trackers drifting.

2. **Governance** → **Realms / SPL Governance** (native, not custom port). Per the "don't reimplement what Solana ships natively" principle. Build a thin normalization layer in `apps/web/src/lib/governance.ts` so the UI hook is chain-agnostic. Accept that proposal/vote/execute UX will have minor differences vs OZ Governor — document the deltas, don't paper over them.

3. **Slop secondary market** → **Tensor + Magic Eden SDK glue** (native, not custom port). `SlopMarket.sol` is too much code for a port and SOL secondary-market UX is anchored on existing native marketplaces. Custom code only for royalty enforcement (Metaplex Core royalty plugin) and listing-creation glue.

4. **Mobile iOS Solana parity** → **One-release lag tolerated, capped.** The three majors (Phantom/Solflare/Backpack) ship via universal links today; that's the floor. Anything beyond is best-effort per release and not a launch blocker. If iOS coverage slips more than one release, escalate.

5. **Phase S5 cluster** → **Stage on public devnet for 30 days first.** Dry-run harness already exists. Stage cost is ~$500; cost of a mainnet rollback is much larger. Open registration only after 30 days of green reconciliation + zero P0/P1 incidents on stage.

---

## 8. Success Criteria

This PRD is complete when:

1. **Audit symmetry** — Anchor program audit reports filed, all P0/P1 findings closed, tracked in the same fix-tracker as EVM.
2. **Custody symmetry** — Squads holds program upgrade, mint, tree, and bridge authorities. No deployer EOA on critical paths.
3. **Surface symmetry** — every EVM-side commercial flow (mint → license → trade → stake → govern → bridge) works on Solana via the same UI, branching at the data layer only.
4. **Indexer symmetry** — every Solana program emits IDL-decoded events into Firestore with the same query shape as Ponder.
5. **SDK + agent symmetry** — `apps/mcp` exposes the same tool surface for both chains.
6. **Operational symmetry** — reconciliation alerts, drift detection, mainnet runbook dry-run all green.
7. **Trust upgrade** — Wormhole NTT live, custodial bridge demoted to fallback.

## 9. Out of Scope (this PRD)

- Adding chains beyond EVM + Solana.
- Migrating canonical IP off EVM.
- Net-new product features that don't exist on either chain today.
- Mainnet pricing / fee model changes (separate work item, depends on [tokenomics.md](tokenomics.md)).
